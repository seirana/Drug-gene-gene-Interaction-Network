By running the code "drug_gene_gene_interaction_networks," a list of suggested drugs for the set of genes and a visualized drug-gene-gene interaction network will be generated.

The file "disease_target_genes.csv" contains the list of desired genes and might have the same structure as the sample file with the same name in the "Drug-gene-gene-Interaction-Network/data" repository.
